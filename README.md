# Sonera router check

This script prints out the power and dB values of incoming and outgoing channels from a Cisco EPC3925 modem's front page whether it's in Router mode or in Bridged mode.

This was done because I was having problems with my internet while I was with Sonera and had their cable connected.
I had one incoming channel going completely dead on my end and in Sonera's system everything was showing up good. With this I was able to monitor what my modem was doing.
While the one channel was down my speed went from 100mb/s down to 10mb/s down while my upload was ok.

Stuff happens and it was fixed with a firmware update but IMO the older model EPC3825 was better.
